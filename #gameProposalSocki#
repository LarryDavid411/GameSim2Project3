Game Proposal:

This game would be a 2D lunar lander style game.

The controls of the game are similar to the lunar lander style game.
There will be gravity, momentum, and thrust that moves the player.
The player will have a certain amount of fuel that they will spend.
If the player is going to fast, they will crash.

There will be things like gates/doors to travel through and the player movement
will need to be timed appropriately.

There will also be things like docking the ship and attaching to other objects.

Things I want to accomplish with this game:

1. Create particle system for things like background stars and the fuel propulsion.
2. Generate different levels and game mechanics.
